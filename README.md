- In a terminal window type gem install rspec
- Once rspec install has finished, type rspec --init
- You will see a folder spec and a file .rspec
- Inside spec folder you'll see a spec_helper.rb file.

## Run
We have already created rspec-testing files called board_spec.rb, helper_spec.rb, player_spec.rb and spec_helper.rb if you want to create another one with the end [your file name]_spec.rb
